# My Portfolio

This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects — it’s a **living, interactive representation** of my skills, creativity, and approach to problem-solving.  
Instead of a plain, static site, I wanted something that reflects how I think, design, and build — combining functionality with engaging visual storytelling.

I started with a blank screen, a vision, and the determination to create something truly my own.  
Every component, animation, and interaction has been crafted intentionally to make the portfolio feel **alive, personal, and expressive**. ✨

## Tech Stack

This portfolio brings together multiple modern tools and libraries to achieve a polished, dynamic experience:

- **React** — For building reusable, maintainable UI components and managing state efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS** — To style the application with clean, responsive, and utility-first classes without writing bulky CSS files.
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** — To create smooth, high-performance animations that respond to user scrolling, enhancing the storytelling aspect of the site.
- **Framer Motion** — For micro-interactions and subtle transitions that make navigation and UI elements feel fluid.
- **VanillaTilt.js** — To add subtle 3D hover effects, making sections more interactive and visually appealing.
- **AI Chatbot** — A local chatbot that users can interact with to learn more about my journey, skills, and projects in a conversational way.

## Purpose & Vision

This project was built with three main goals in mind:

1. **Showcase My Work**  
   Present my skills, projects, and achievements in a structured yet engaging way.

2. **Reflect My Personality**  
   Use animations, design choices, and interactivity to give visitors a sense of who I am as a developer.

3. **Demonstrate My Skills**  
   Combine different frontend technologies to create a seamless, responsive, and modern user experience.

Unlike traditional portfolios, this one is designed to be **explored**, not just scrolled through.  
The animations guide the visitor through each section, making the journey as important as the destination.
